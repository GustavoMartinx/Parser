<h1 align='center'> Parser (Analisador Sint√°tico) </h1>
<p> This work aims to implement a parser for arithmetic expressions in the C- programming language through a pushdown automaton (PDA). </p> <br>
<p> This project was based on the "Action Go-to" table of the SLR(1) algorithm of the generator grammar of the language of expressions, with the help of the JFLAP software. </p> <br>
<p> The program receives as input a list of simplified (only arithmetic expressions) C- language tokens (generated by the lexical analysis process) and, as output, recognizes whether the arithmetic expressions inserted in the input were accepted or not.</p>
